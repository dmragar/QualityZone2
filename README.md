# QualityZone2
QualityZone v2.1

QualityZone 2 is a set of functions for creating a dataframe from time-series data stored in dropbox (.dat or .csv), and has options for live datastreams (e.g. LoggerNet networks) *or* manual downloads from laptops in the field. Each site has a control file specifying the proper directory structure, the QC tests applied to the dataframe, the distributable file formatting, and the plotting code. QC changes are made via the "working file" in a Jupyter notebook.
